1. Clone this repo and in repo create a create-react-app from scratch and run it
2. Clean up the code as we did in class (remove unecessary elements and customize your own for practice)
3. In your app.js display H1 heading, display an unordered list with 3 list elements-- also modify the ul styling by adding a ul style in your css
4. Create a custom style inline by using a javascript object and modify your h1 tag
5. Add a const name = "Your name" and add that to your H1 tag
6. Add a random number generator and add "your lucky number is ___"
7. Add functionality that greets your name by checking the time of day, if it is before noon, greet with good morning and if it is afternoon, good afternoon, and good evening if after 6
8. Create a custom component called List that will include your list elements in a separate js file, and import it into your app.js
9. the app function should return `<List />`
10. In the end, your index.js file should only contain `<App />` and everything else should be in a component
11. Add anything else you want to practice and let me know in comments.
